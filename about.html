									Welcome to my character page! This is basically a little dumping ground for my various story/RPG characters across various games. You'll find graphics, profiles, commissioned art, and other 
            little details here relating to each of my characters. Feel free to hunt me down using any of the info you find under Contacts!</p></div>

									You'll find that I'm actually pretty lax about what I want/don't want done with my characters as far as plots go.</p>
									
									<p>ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS. THROW 'EM AT ME. SHOWER ME WITH THEM. Just, uh, run anything potentially life-changing by me first before you commit to anything.</p>
									
									<p>For <b>romance</b>, always ask first! I don't mind at all if your character has a thing for one of mine, but please no relationship railroading. I'd like things to develop naturally. I also prefer to fade to 
									black when it comes to explicit scenes, but I don't mind doing the stuff that leads up to it. (There's people that are really good at writing porn, but I am regrettably not one of them.)</p>
									
									<p><b>Violence, rivalries, hate, ect</b> - those are always fun, but ASK FIRST if you want your character to potentially get into a violent situation with one of mine. Especially if this is going to be
									rated M. Would rather not have a character lose an ear, be injured heavily, or end up in a coma without my prior knowledge.</p>
									
									<p><b>Family</b> is a little tricky. Typically, I like to set those up beforehand, during the character's backstory, so unfortunately, I don't allow siblings or parents or cousins to be created outside
										of my character's  bio. HOWEVER, if I need that particular character for a plot or an RP session, I'll specifically ask for that character. At that point, you can either keep the character and 
										develop them, or just delete him and he'll be our little one-off.</p>
